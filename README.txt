The Inventory Management System is a console-based Java application designed to help manage and monitor product stocks efficiently. Users can add items, view inventory, search products, update stock quantities, and delete items when necessary. This project showcases practical implementation of Java OOP concepts, Collections framework, and structured programming techniques.
It is developed in accordance with given VITyarthi project guidelines for Java coursework.
